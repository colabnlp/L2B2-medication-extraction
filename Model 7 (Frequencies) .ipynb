in the left circumflex artery consistent with instant restenosis of her previously placed pixel stent the right coronary artery showed a <num>% lesion during this catheterization , brachytherapy to the vessel that showed instant restenosis was attempted , however , it was aborted due to technical malfunction of the brachytherapy delivery machine the lesion was , however , dilated by balloon

that time revealed a significant drop in blood count to <num>. the patient was transfused two units of packed red blood cells her hematoma continue to expand overnight the patient was discontinued from lovenox at that time however , she was continued on aspirin and plavix the patient's lovenox was reversed with protamine over the night , the patient's hematoma continued to expand she received , the following morning on january , <num> , one unit of fresh frozen plasma as well as a third unit of packed red blood cells at that point , her hematoma was marked and it was noted to be stable from that point on , no longer expanding beyond the bounds of the marks her left arm was noted at that time to also be tense with hematoma secondary to blood draws vascular surgery was consulted in the morning on january , <num> , in order to assess the right groin hematoma as well as the hematoma in the left arm due to concern for developing compartment syndrome vascular surgery saw the patient and felt that as long as the patient's hematocrit stabilized , she would not need any surgical intervention they could not find any evidence for left upper extremity compartment syndrome at that time also on the morning of january , <num> , the patient's platelets agents including both plavix and aspirin were discontinued further family history was obtained from the patient that day which revealed history suspicious for possible bleeding disorder including the information that the patient's daughter bleeds heavily with each menstrual period , and that both the patient and her daughter have very easy bruising with history of several hematomas secondary to light trauma the patient also reported that she had heavy bleeding with childbirth that required extra hospitalization although it did not require a transfusion hematology was consulted at that point the patient was thought by hematology to have these hematomas secondary to over anticoagulation with lovenox , plavix , aspirin and possible stonde medical center trial drug with a kenda medical center the only familial coagulation problems that were screened for based on their recommendations were von willebrand screen as well as a factor xiii screen the factor xiii screen eventually turned out normal and the von willebrand screen was pending at the time of discharge by the morning of november , <num> , the patient had received a total of five units of packed red blood cells due to blood loss secondary to this hematoma her hematoma had stabilized at that time she was restarted on aspirin on november , <num>. from

same as she frequently experiences at home her headaches are usually not responsive to tylenol or other analgesics given the patient's complications with hematoma and bleeding , a head ct was obtained

systolic pressure of <num> plus ra but no wall motion abnormalities it was felt that she had some element of diastolic dysfunction that caused her to go into a bit of pulmonary edema , maybe
