chest pain had been increasing in frequency over the past two to three weeks so now it occurred approximately two to three times a week and was associated with shortness of breath two days prior to admission , she developed constant chest pain that went to her left arm and made four of her left fingers numb she was quite short of breath though she denied paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , orthopnea

and kerley b lines her laboratories on admission were all within normal limits her initial ck was <num> with troponin of <num>.<num> assessment in summary , this is a <num> year old woman with multiple cardiac risk factors who presented with chest pain of unclear etiology she was admitted for evaluation hospital course <num>. cardiovascular - she was admitted for catheterization which showed three vessel disease , again nonsignificant and not changed from the catheterization in <num>. she ruled out for a myocardial infarction she had an echo which showed some element of diastolic dysfunction and pulmonary artery systolic pressure of <num> plus ra but no wall motion abnormalities it was felt that she had some element of diastolic dysfunction that caused her to go into a bit of pulmonary edema , maybe subendocardial ischemia therefore , while she was maintained on her \u001b[42mASPIRIN\u001b[49m and \u001b[42mSIMVASTATIN\u001b[49m , her blood pressure regimen was advanced

scan which was low probability her lower extremity noninvasives were negative she also had a chest ct which showed no interstitial lung disease she had pulmonary function tests which were consistent with restrictive picture and were not much changed from her pulmonary function tests in <num>. a pulmonary consultation was obtained who believed that the congestive heart failure along with obesity underlying restrictive lung disease could be the cause of her hypoxia and , in fact , after further diuresis , her shortness of breath much improved and she had o<num> saturations that were <num>% on
