discharge date <num>/<num>/<num> admission diagnosis chest pain of unclear etiology history of the present illness ms veltin is a <num> year old woman with a past medical history significant for coronary artery disease , diabetes , and hypertension who presented with worsening chest pain and shortness of breath she had a long history of coronary artery disease with an exercise stress test in <num> that was positive for ischemic st-t wave changes she had a catheterization at that time which revealed diffuse three vessel disease , none of which was significant in <num> , she developed a left bundle branch on her ekg but it was not clear when exactly this happened she stated that for the past year , she got these stabbing pains in the center of her chest that then progressed to a squeezing pain with palpitations sometimes , there was relation to exertion but no relation to meals or position and this chest pain had been increasing in frequency over the past two to three weeks so now it occurred approximately two to three times a week and was associated with shortness of breath two days prior to admission , she developed constant chest pain that went to her left arm and made four of her left fingers numb she was quite short of breath though she denied paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , orthopnea , lower extremity edema , increased nocturia , and diet or medication noncompliance past medical history significant also for diabetes for which she took \u001b[42mINSULIN\u001b[49m and checked her sugars at home which ran <num> range to <num> range , hypertension , and she had idiopathic drop attacks she got these episodes where her legs fell out from under her without warning but she did not lose consciousness she had had an mri/mra that showed some diffuse small

she lived alone and took care of her eight year old great-grandson but had a daughter and son-in-law who lived next door physical examination on admission , significant for an elderly obese african-american woman lying in bed in some mild respiratory distress her oropharynx was moist , her jugular venous pressure was <num> cm , her lungs had scattered crackles at the bases , her heart was regular with an s<num> , her belly was soft and nontender , her extremities had trace edema , and her rectal examination showed guaiac negative brown stool laboratory examination her ekg showed a left bundle branch block and chest x-ray showed mild pulmonary edema and kerley \u001b[43mB\u001b[49m lines her laboratories on admission were all within normal limits her initial ck was <num> with troponin of <num>.<num> assessment in summary , this is a <num> year old woman with multiple cardiac risk factors who presented with chest pain of unclear etiology she was admitted for evaluation hospital course <num>. cardiovascular - she was admitted for catheterization which showed three vessel disease , again nonsignificant and not changed from the catheterization in <num>. she ruled out for a myocardial infarction she had an echo which showed some element of diastolic dysfunction and pulmonary artery systolic pressure of <num> plus ra but no wall motion abnormalities it was felt that she had some element of diastolic dysfunction that caused her to go into a bit of pulmonary edema , maybe subendocardial ischemia therefore , while she was maintained on her \u001b[42mASPIRIN\u001b[49m and \u001b[42mSIMVASTATIN\u001b[49m , her blood pressure \u001b[43mREGIMEN\u001b[49m was advanced her heart rate was in the fifties to sixties and

discharged on a seven day course of \u001b[42mLASIX\u001b[49m at <num> po qd for further diuresis <num>. pulmonary - she did have hypoxia on admission to <num>% on room air while lying in bed this was felt to be out of proportion to her mild congestive heart failure and further causes were sought her d-dymer was greater than <num> and she then went for a v/q scan which was low probability her lower extremity noninvasives were negative she also had a chest ct which showed no interstitial lung disease she had pulmonary function tests which were consistent with restrictive picture and were not much changed from her pulmonary function tests in <num>. a pulmonary consultation was obtained who believed that the congestive heart failure along with obesity underlying restrictive lung disease could be the cause of her hypoxia and , in fact , after further diuresis , her shortness of breath much improved and she had o<num> saturations that were <num>% on room air <num>. endocrine - she was maintained on \u001b[42mMETFORMIN\u001b[49m during admission and also on half of her dose of her normal dose of \u001b[42mNPH\u001b[49m given her decreased po intake , however , given the fact that
