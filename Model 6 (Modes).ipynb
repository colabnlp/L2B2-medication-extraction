was marked and it was noted to be stable from that point on , no longer expanding beyond the bounds of the marks her left arm was noted at that time to also be tense with hematoma secondary to blood draws vascular surgery was consulted in the morning on january , <num> , in order to assess the right groin hematoma as well as the hematoma in the left arm due to concern for developing compartment syndrome vascular surgery saw the patient and felt that as long as the patient's hematocrit stabilized , she would not need any surgical intervention they could not find any evidence for left upper extremity compartment syndrome at that time also on the morning of january , <num> , the patient's platelets agents including both plavix and aspirin were discontinued further family history was obtained from the patient that day which revealed history suspicious for possible bleeding disorder including the information that the patient's daughter bleeds heavily with each menstrual period , and that both the patient and her daughter have very easy bruising with history of several hematomas secondary to light trauma the patient also reported that she had heavy bleeding with childbirth that required extra hospitalization although it did not require a transfusion hematology was consulted at that point the patient was thought by hematology to have these hematomas secondary to over anticoagulation with lovenox , plavix , aspirin and possible stonde medical center trial drug with a kenda medical center the only familial coagulation problems that were screened for based on their recommendations were von willebrand screen as well as a factor xiii screen the factor xiii screen eventually turned out normal and the von willebrand screen was pending at the time of discharge by the morning of november , <num> , the patient had received a total of five units of packed red blood cells due to blood loss secondary to this hematoma her hematoma had stabilized at that time she was

, the patient developed a headache which she described as the same as she frequently experiences at home her headaches are usually not responsive to tylenol or other analgesics given the patient's

old woman with a past medical history significant for coronary artery disease , diabetes , and hypertension who presented with worsening chest pain and shortness of breath she had a long history of coronary artery disease with an exercise stress test in <num> that was positive for ischemic st-t wave changes she had a catheterization at that time which revealed diffuse three vessel disease , none of which was significant in <num> , she developed a left bundle branch on her ekg but it was not clear when exactly this happened she stated that for the past year , she got these stabbing pains in the center of her chest that then progressed to a squeezing pain with palpitations sometimes , there was relation to exertion but no relation to meals or position and this chest pain had been increasing in frequency over the past two to three weeks so now it occurred approximately two to three times a week and was associated with shortness of breath two days prior to admission , she developed constant chest pain that went to her left arm and made four of her left fingers numb she was quite short of breath though she denied paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , orthopnea , lower extremity edema , increased nocturia , and diet or medication noncompliance past medical history significant also for diabetes for which she took insulin and checked her sugars at home which ran <num> range to <num> range , hypertension , and she had idiopathic drop attacks she got these episodes where her legs fell out from under her without warning but she did not lose consciousness she had had an mri/mra that showed some diffuse small vessel disease but the mra was normal current medications atenolol <num> bid , hydrochlorothiazide <num> qd , lisinopril <num> qd , simvastatin <num> qd ,

she was a widow , and she had two living children who were grown she lived alone and took care of her eight year old great-grandson but had a daughter and son-in-law who lived next door physical examination on admission , significant for an elderly obese african-american woman lying in bed in some mild respiratory distress her oropharynx was moist , her jugular venous pressure was <num> cm , her lungs had scattered crackles at the bases , her heart was regular with an s<num> , her belly was soft and nontender , her extremities had trace edema , and her rectal examination showed guaiac negative brown stool laboratory examination her ekg showed a left bundle branch block and chest x-ray showed mild pulmonary edema and kerley b lines her laboratories on admission were all within normal limits her initial ck was <num> with troponin of <num>.<num> assessment in summary , this is a <num> year old woman with multiple cardiac risk factors who presented with chest pain of unclear etiology she was admitted for evaluation hospital course <num>. cardiovascular - she was admitted for catheterization which showed three vessel disease , again nonsignificant and not changed from the catheterization in <num>. she ruled out for a myocardial infarction she had an echo which showed some element of diastolic dysfunction and pulmonary artery systolic pressure of <num> plus ra but no wall motion abnormalities it was felt that she had some element of diastolic dysfunction that caused her to go into a bit of pulmonary edema , maybe subendocardial ischemia therefore , while she was maintained on her aspirin and simvastatin , her blood pressure regimen was advanced her heart rate was in the fifties to sixties and atenolol <num> bid was added she was on a maximum of lisinopril at <num> milligrams so nifedipine extended release was added and titrated up to <num> milligrams qd where she maintained systolic blood pressures in the <num> range nevertheless this could be further titrated as an outpatient <num>. for her congestive heart failure , she diuresed approximately four liters through admission with lasix at <num> \u001b[42mINTRAVENOUSLY\u001b[49m and would be discharged on a seven day course of lasix at <num> \u001b[41mPO\u001b[49m qd for further diuresis <num>. pulmonary - she did have hypoxia on admission to <num>% on room air while lying in bed this was felt to be out of proportion to her mild congestive heart failure and further causes were sought her d-dymer was greater than <num> and she then went for a v/q scan which was low probability her lower extremity noninvasives were negative she also had a chest ct which showed no interstitial lung disease she had pulmonary function tests which were consistent with restrictive picture and were not much changed from her pulmonary function tests in <num>. a pulmonary consultation was obtained who believed that the congestive heart failure along with obesity underlying restrictive lung disease could be the cause of her hypoxia and , in fact , after further diuresis , her shortness of breath much improved and she had o<num> saturations that were <num>% on room air <num>. endocrine - she was maintained on metformin during admission and also on half of her dose of her normal dose of nph given her decreased po intake , however , given the fact that she stated that her sugars at home on her regimen of <num> qam and <num> qpm were <num> to <num> , she was discharged on this regimen with instructions to check her sugar and call her doctor if they were low disposition she is discharged in
