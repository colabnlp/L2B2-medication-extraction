increasing in frequency over the past two to three weeks so now it occurred approximately two to three times a week and was associated with shortness of breath two days prior to admission , she developed constant chest pain that went to her left arm and made four of her left fingers numb she was quite short of breath though she denied paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , orthopnea , lower

which were consistent with restrictive picture and were not much changed from her pulmonary function tests in <num>. a pulmonary consultation was obtained who believed that the congestive heart
